## Motivation
How long will it take for random typing to recreate one of Shakespeare's greatest works?

[The Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) is famous for its profound __ on the concept of infinity, despite its ridiculous premise.
It states that given enough time, a monkey randomly typing characters will at some point recreate the complete works of Shakespeare.
Furthermore, the monkey will recreate any finite length text. Of course, the odds of this happening are extremely low (discussed in [Expected Time to Complete Challenge](#expected-time-to-complete-challenge)).
The goal of this project is to simulate random typing (at least as well as python's random library allows us to) and see if our "monkey" gets really really really lucky in recreating Shakespeare's works.
